Getting started
----------------

`logtint` lets you add color and style to your logs with a single, easy-to-use API.
It works in both Node.js and the browser, handling the messy stuff behind the scenes ‚Äî ANSI codes for terminals, CSS for
browsers.
You just write your log once, and it figures out the rest.

### How to install

```shell
npm install logtint
```

### How to use

You wrap the parts of the message with utilities like `bold`, `cyan`, or any other to apply styling.
Once you have your message ready, you need it to pass it through `log` function to make the styling work.

```javascript
import log, { underline, bold } from "logtint"

log`By default, your messages are output through ${underline`console.log.`}.`
log(console.info)`But do you know you can output your messages through ${bold`any`} function?`
log(console.error)`You just need to pass a function that takes the message as its first argument!`
```

> [!TIP]  
> Most `logtint` utilities can be used as both functions and template literals  
> Use the syntax that fits best for your use case ‚Äî they‚Äôre interchangeable!

Want to turn a color into a background? Just wrap it with `bg(...)`.  
Need a brighter version of a color? Make it brighter with `bright(...)`.

And yes ‚Äî you can mix them!

```javascript
import log, { bright, bg, yellow } from "logtint"

log(bg(yellow)`You can make any color a background color!`)
log(bright(yellow)`Or maybe you just need a brighter color?`)
log(bright(bg(yellow))(yellow`Yellow text on a bright yellow background? Just use both!`))
```

Use `tint` whenever you must keep your tinted reusable bits for later!

```javascript
import log, { tint, italic, bg, blue } from "logtint"

const message = tint`A ${italic`reusable`} message.`
const logger = (level, message) =>
    tint`[${level}] ${message}`
const debug = bg(blue)`DEBUG`

// Hijack your console.log 
console.log = (message) => {
    log(console.log)`${logger(debug, message)}`
}

console.log(message)
```

A lot of crayons to choose from!  
All tree-shakeable to keep your bundles lean and mean.

```javascript
import {
    // Crayons for text formatting
    bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, dim, inverse, hidden,
    // Crayons for coloring
    black, white, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan,
    // Crayon modifiers
    bg, bright
} from "logtint"
```

Compose and reuse!

```javascript
import log, { bright, magenta, bold, italic, underline } from "logtint"

const highlight = bright(magenta)
const format = (text) => highlight(bold(italic(underline(text))))

log`You can compose them and combine them into a ${format("single crayon combo")}.`
```

Or make your own!

```javascript
import log, { crayon, TextStyle } from "logtint"

const overline = crayon(TintStyle("text-decoration: overline;", 9 /* underline */))

log`You need your own? ${overline("We've got you covered!")}`
```
